1. What is React JS and what problems does it solve? Support your answer with concepts introduced in class and from your personal research on the web.

React JS is a language that combines HTML JS and CSS by using components. It creates these reusable components that help solve issues with multiple states.

1. Describe component state.

A component state is where we keep information about component and it changes over time.

1. Describe props.
Props are defined in each component and are used to pass down data.

1. What are side effects, and how do you sync effects in a React component to changes of certain state or props?

Side effects happen as a result of a function continuing to render and you sync effects in a React component to changes of certain state or props through the useEffect function.
